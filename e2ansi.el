;;; Commentary:

;; *e2ansi* (Emacs to ANSI) provides syntax highlighting support for
;; `less' and for other tools that run in terminal windows.
;;
;; The `e2ansi-cat' command line tool use ANSI escape sequences to
;; syntax highlight source files. The actual syntax highlighting is
;; performed by Emacs, the mother of all text editors, running in
;; batch mode.
;;
;; Pager applications like `more' and `less' can be configured to
;; automatically invoke `e2ansi-cat', so that all viewed files will be
;; syntax highlighted. A nice side effect is that other conversions
;; that Emacs normally performs, like uncompressing files, are also
;; automatically applied.
;;
;; Example:
;;
;; | Before                     | After                         |
;; | ------                     | -----                         |
;; | ![](doc/no_color_dark.png) | ![](doc/default_dark_256.png) |

;; Syntax:
;;
;; The `e2ansi-cat' command line tool is written in Emacs Lisp. To
;; start it, use:
;;
;;     emacs --batch [...Emacs options...] -l bin/e2ansi-cat [...options...]
;;
;; Alternatively, on UNIX-like operating systems the `e2ansi-cat' can
;; be executed directly, assuming that the `bin' directory is in the
;; load path. This assumes that Emacs is installed as `/usr/bin/emacs':
;;
;;     e2ansi-cat [...options...]
;;
;; Note, due to how Emacs parses options, some options passed to
;; `e2ansi-cat' is parsed by Emacs. Most notably, passing the option
;; `--help' to `e2ansi-cat' displays help for Emacs itself.
;;
;; Command line options:
;;
;; * `--background-mode' -- Specify `light' or `dark' background mode.
;;
;; * `--colors' -- Number of colors, or `rgb24' for full 24 bit
;;   colors. This is both used when mapping faces to actual colors and
;;   to decide the kind of ANSI sequences that is used.
;;
;; * `--color-class' -- Specify `color' or `grayscale'.
;;
;; * `--theme' -- Specify the color theme to use.
;;
;; * `--usage' -- Show help text.

;; Integration with `less':
;;
;; The standard command line tool `less' can be configured to
;; preprocess any output given to it. `e2ansi-cat' can be used to
;; generate a syntax highlighted version. This is enabled by setting
;; the following environment variables, for example, to (using bash
;; syntax):
;;
;;     export "LESSOPEN=|emacs --batch -l ~/.emacs -l bin/e2ansi-cat %s"
;;     export "LESS=-R"
;;     export "MORE=-R"
;;
;; The `LESSOPEN' environment variable is used by `less' to specify an
;; input preprocessor. When using `e2ansi', the first character should
;; be a `|', this signals to less that the input preprocessor prints
;; the result on standard output.
;;
;; The above example assumes that your init file is named `.emacs' and
;; located in your home directory. It also assumes that it adds the
;; location of the `e2ansi' package to the load path.
;;
;; `less' and pipes:
;;
;; Modern versions of `less' can also use the input preprocessor when
;; used in a pipe, for example:
;;
;;     svn diff | less
;;
;; For this, the `LESSOPEN' environment variable must start with `|-'.
;; In this case, the file name `-' is passed to the input
;; preprocessor, which is expected to read from standard input.
;;
;;     export "LESSOPEN=|-emacs --batch -l ~/.emacs -l bin/e2ansi-cat %s"
;;
;; Note: If your version of `less' is too old, using `|-' typically
;; yields error like "/bin/bash: -/: invalid option".
;;
;; Also note that this makes it hard for Emacs to select a suitable
;; major mode, as it can not base this on the file name extension.
;; Typically, this result in incorrect or no highlighting.
;; Fortunately, Emacs has the ability inspect the file content when
;; selecting major mode, see `magic-mode-alist' for details. The
;; support file `e2ansi-magic.el' adds some file types to the list,
;; e.g. the `diff' format used by `svn'. You must explicitly load it
;; to take effect, either using `-l e2ansi-magic.el' or by loading in
;; from another file that is being loaded, like your init file.

;; Emacs init files:
;;
;; When using Emacs in batch mode, Emacs reads the system init file
;; but not the user init file.
;;
;; If you want to load your personal init file, you can load it using
;; -l command line option, for example:
;;
;;     emacs -l ~/.emacs -l bin/e2ansi-cat file ...
;;
;; To avoid loading the system init file, you can specify the -Q
;; command line option:
;;
;;     emacs -Q -l ~/.emacs -l bin/e2ansi-cat file ...
;;
;; Adapting your init file to batch mode:
;;
;; As Emacs most often is used in interactive mode there is a risk
;; that parts of the system or your init file doesn't work in batch
;; mode.
;;
;; To exclude something when in batch mode, you can use:
;;
;;     (unless noninteractive
;;       .. original code goes here ... )

;; Silencing messages:
;;
;; When Emacs is used in batch mode, message are emitted on the
;; standard error stream. This includes messages emitted when files
;; are loaded.
;;
;; On UNIX-like operating systems, the standard error stream can be
;; redirected to /dev/null, for example:
;;
;;     emacs --batch -l ~/.emacs -l bin/e2ansi-cat 2> /dev/null
;;
;; Alternatively, the file `e2ansi-silent' can be loaded. This file
;; has the advantages that the Usage information of `e2ansi-cat' is
;; printed (when started without arguments) and that it works on all
;; operating systems. (If you load it before your init file, you might
;; need to specify the full path.)
;;
;;     emacs --batch -l e2ansi-silent -l ~/.emacs -l bin/e2ansi-cat ...
;;
;; Silencing messages in `site-start.el':
;;
;; Normally, the file `site-start.el' is loaded by Emacs before any
;; file specified on the command line. To silence messages emitted by
;; this file, you can suppress loading it using -Q, load
;; `e2ansi-silent' and explicitly load the site-start file:
;;
;;     emacs --batch -Q -l e2ansi-silent -l ../site-lisp/site-start -l ...
;;
;; Note: When -Q is used, the `site-lisp' directory is not included in
;; the load path, the `../site-lisp' part compensate for this.

;; Emacs modules:
;;
;; * `e2ansi.el' -- Render a syntax highlighted buffer using ANSI
;;   escape sequences. This can be used both in normal interactive
;;   mode and in batch mode.
;;
;; * `e2ansi-magic.el' -- Set up `magic-mode-alist' to recognize file
;;   formats based on the content of files. This is useful when using
;;   `less' in pipes where Emacs can't use the file name extension to
;;   select a suitable major mode.
;;
;; * `e2ansi-silent.el' -- Load this in batch mode to silence some
;;   messages from init files.
;;
;; * `bin/e2ansi-cat' -- The command line tool for converting files in
;;   batch mode.
;;
;; * `bin/e2ansi-info' -- Print various ANSI-related information to
;;   help you trim your ANSI environment.

;; Background:
;;
;; What is Emacs:
;;
;; Emacs is a the mother of all text editors. It originates from the
;; 1970:s, but is still in active development. It runs under all major
;; operating systems, including MS-Windows, Mac OS X, and various
;; UNIX-like systems like Linux. You can use normal windows, run it in
;; a terminal window (great when working remotely), or use it to run
;; scripts in batch mode, which is how it is used by the command line
;; tools provided by this package.
;;
;; Emacs provides state-of-the-art syntax highlighting.
;;
;; Why use Emacs to power syntax highlighting in the terminal:
;;
;; * Emacs has support for a vast range of programming languages and
;;   other structured text formats.
;;
;; * Emacs is fast and accurate -- it is designed for interactive use,
;;   and provides advanced support for ensuring that a source buffer
;;   is parsed correctly.
;;
;; * Emacs supports color themes. If you don't like the ones provided,
;;   and can't find one on internet, you can easily write your own.
;;
;; * To add syntax highlighting support for other formats can easily be
;;   done by providing a standard Emacs major mode, where the syntax
;;   highlighting is provided by Font Lock keywords. You can use
;;   `font-lock-studio' to debug those keywords, it allows you single
;;   step match by match and it visualizes matches using a palette of
;;   background colors.

;; ANSI sequences:
;;
;; ANSI sequences, formally known as ISO/IEC 6429, is a system used by
;; various physical terminals and console programs to, for example,
;; render colors and text attributes such as bold and italics.
;;
;; See [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code) for
;; more information.
;;
;; Colors:
;;
;; Both foreground and background colors can be rendered. Note that
;; faces with the same background as the default face is not rendered
;; with a background.
;;
;; Four modes are supported:
;;
;; * 8 -- The eight basic ANSI colors are supported.
;;
;; * 16 -- The eight basic colors, plus 8 "bright" colors. These are
;;   represented as "bold" versions of the above.
;;
;; * 256 -- Some modern terminal programs support a larger palette.
;;   This consist of the 16 basic colors, a 6*6*6 color cube plus a
;;   grayscale.
;;
;; * 24 bit -- Support for 256*256*256 colors.
;;
;; Attributes:
;;
;; * Bold
;;
;; * Italics
;;
;; * Underline

;; Operating system notes:
;;
;; Mac OS X:
;;
;; Mas OS X comes bundled with Emacs. Unfortunately, it's a relatively
;; old version, 22.1.1. It is fully functional, but it lacks some
;; features. Most notably, the default face definitions are broken
;; when 8 colors are used.
;;
;; You can download a modern version from
;; [EmacsForOSX](http://emacsforosx.com). Once installed, the path to
;; the Emacs binary is typically
;; `/Applications/Emacs.app/Contents/MacOS/Emacs'.
;;
;; The version of `less' that is preinstalled on 10.9 is 418 dating
;; from 2007. It supports the input preprocessors for named files (the
;; `|' syntax) but not for pipes (The `|-' syntax).
;;
;; Fortunately, it's easy to download and build a new version of
;; `less' from http://www.greenwoodsoftware.com/less
;;
;; Why Apple has not included a newer version, I do not understand.
;; Some claim that Apple is actively avoiding software licensed under
;; GPLv3+. However, `less' is available under two licenses so this
;; should not be a problem. I guess it's down to laziness and opting
;; to spend resources to invent yet another way of making menus
;; semi-opaque rather than providing their users with up to date
;; tools.
;;
;; Microsoft Windows:
;;
;; The command window in Microsoft Windows does not understand ANSI
;; sequences. Fortunately, modern versions of `less' is capable of
;; rendering ANSI sequences using colors.
;;
;; Unfortunately, I'm not aware of any up to date distribution of
;; prebuilt versions of `less'. To make things worse, the build
;; scripts provided with `less' is somewhat hard to use.
;;
;; In the document
;; [LessWindows](https://github.com/Lindydancer/e2ansi/doc/LessWindows.md)
;; I describe how to build `less' using `cmake', a modern build
;; system.

;; Gallery:
;;
;; All images are screen captures of `less' running in a terminal
;; window. White or black backgrounds were used, even though some
;; themes have other backgrounds, when used inside Emacs.
;;

;; Future development:
;;
;; This sections consists of things that might or might not appear in
;; this package in the future.
;;
;; More command line tools:
;;
;; More command line tools could make life simpler. For example:
;;
;; * `e2ansi-exec' -- Run another command line tools and convert all
;;   arguments (that looks like files) to the corresponding ansi
;;   format. (To avoid converting files that should not be converted,
;;   this tool must include knowledge regarding common commands.) One
;;   problem with this tool is the bizarre way Emacs treats command
;;   line options -- hence, the entire tool, or parts of it, must be
;;   written in another script language like Ruby.q
;;
;; * `e2ansi-tmp' -- Render a syntax highlighted version of a file as
;;   a temporary file and print the file name. This way a user could
;;   use the shell backquote syntax to feed syntax highlighted
;;   versions of a file to a third tool, for example:
;;
;;         atool `e2ansi-tmp afile.c`
;;
;;   A technical problem with this tool is that it leaves the
;;   temporary file behind. Hence, some kind of garbage collection
;;   mechanism must be put in place.
;;
;; Generalization:
;;
;; Much of the code in this package is generic. It could most likely
;; be used to generate other output formats like Markdown. One idea is
;; to break out the generic parts to a separate package.
;;
;; Faster response time:
;;
;; * By using a resident Emacs process, response time could be greatly
;;   reduced. Today, a bare-bone Emacs start fast, however, if you use
;;   a heavy init file (like I do) the start-up time goes up
;;   noticeably.
;;
;; * Incremental syntax highlighting. Today, the entire buffer is
;;   syntax highlighted at once, before it is converted to ANSI. By
;;   only run font-lock on parts of the buffer before printing it, a
;;   receiving application like `less' could start faster.
;;
;; Miscellaneous:
;;
;; Various things.
;;
;; * Check how things look when using a dark background, maybe
;;   something would need to be added to the overrides list.
;;
;; * Don't use the "brightxxx" color names, they are not used by Emacs
;;   and it's only confusing.
;;
;; * Add unit tests for individual parts and full source file tests
;;   where the entire output is compared against a known ANSI
;;   representation, as done in my `faceup' package.
;;
;; * Describe Emacs font specification selection process.
;;
;; * Better error handling when parsing command line arguments.
;;
;; * Customization support.
;;
;; * Optimize ANSI sequences. Today, whenever there is a change, a
;;   reset is emitted, plus codes to set all properties. However,
;;   sometimes it would be shorter to simple, say, add underline, and
;;   without touching the other properties.
;;
;; * Security issues: Don't allow file local variables, or anything
;;   else, allow arbitrary elisp code to be executed when a file is
;;   viewed.
;;
;; * Use floating point numbers when scoring, rather than scaling
;;   down.
;;
;; * Promote some of the "list" commands from the "test" package.
;;
;; * Inhibit rendering ANSI sequences when running `less' on a file
;;   already containing ANSI sequences.
;;
;; * Add `--force' to force e2ansi to render a file using ANSI
;;   sequences, even when such sequences are found in the file.
;;
;; * Mention `||-' in the documentation.
;;
;; * Investigate why backgrounds spanning mutiple lines misbehaves in
;;   Terminal.app (and other terminals). Maybe always reset the
;;   background at the end of each line?

;; Acknowledgment:
;;
;; Mark, thanks for writing `less'!

;; ANSI Colors
;;

;;
;; * 8 basic colors.
;;
;; * 8 basic colors + 8 bright colors.
;;
;;   The bright colors are typically accessed by setting the bold
;;   attribute, and are only available for the foreground color. In
;;   some cases, not all colors appears to be available as bright
;;   (but we ignore this.)
;;
;; * 256 colors, consisting of the 8 + 8 basic colors, 6*6*6 = 216
;;   colors in a color cube, and 24 shades of gray. When a face has
;;   specified to use a named color, and that color is one of the
;;   basic ones, that color is used. Otherwise the one with the
;;   closest color value in the color cube or in the grayscale is
;;   picked. The ANSI escape sequences "ESC [ 38 ; 5 ; N m" and "48"
;;   are used.
;;
;; * 24 bit RGB (256 * 256 * 256). The exact 3*8 bit RGB color value
;;   is emitted using the "ESC [ 38 ; 2 ; R ; G ; B m" and "48"
;;   sequences.
